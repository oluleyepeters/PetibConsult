in this we will be adding the edit and update route
we have to add the method override, then require it in the app.js.
then create the edit page
we also have to delete the design
this is done through a form that  will be added to the show page link
we also want to make sure that if you are not authenicated you wont be able to delete or edit a design that is not yours
firstly we have to check if the user is logged in
then check if the user owns the campground
we also have to enable hiding and showing the delete and update button
Everything we did above should also be applied to the comment

app.get('/*', function(req,res,next) {
  req.session.flash = [];
  next();
});
